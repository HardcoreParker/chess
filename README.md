# Chess
## Purpose
I started this project with a few goals in mind:
* Practice tests first Test Driven Development
* Practice feature driven commits - impromptu enhancements and modifications outside the scope of current task are commented as a TODO and revisited at a dedicated time
* Keep Java and problem solving skills fresh
* Publicly publish Java code
* Have fun!

## Current status
Not actively developed. A move across the west-coast and front end dev work showed up on my doorstep and robbed this project of my attention.

The project is currently incomplete, requiring more love in edge case unit testing & logic, calculating check & checkmate, improving performance and encapsulation. I'm focusing on progress over pedanticism, so those last parts will come after the game is fully functional.

For time reasons, I won't be implementing Castling, Promotion, or En passant on my first pass through this project.
