# Chess
## Purpose
I started this project with a few goals in mind:
* Practice tests first Test Driven Development
* Practice feature driven commits - impromptu enhancements and modifications outside the scope of current task are commented as a TODO and revisited at a dedicated time
* Keep Java and problem solving skills fresh
* Publicly publish Java code
* Have fun!

## Current status

The project is currently incomplete but actively being developed, requiring more love in edge case unit testing & logic, calculating check & checkmate, improving performance and encapsulation. I'm focusing on progress over pedanticism, so those last parts will come after the game is fully functional.

For time reasons, I won't be implementing Castling, Promotion, or En passant on my first pass through this project.
